## Making world truly chainless once and for all

Fetcch is building a suite of products to build a truly chainless future.
Starting with products for finance

# Our Products

We want to build a chainless world where users don't have to mess around with

- Too many chains
- Too clumsy and many addresses

If these 2 are solved, we can have a truly chainless world where addresses don't matter

- **Fetcch Bridge** will provide seamless interoperability between chains
- **FetcchX ID** will span across chains and eliminate the need of addresses 

Let's understand them deeply

### Fetcch Bridge

Fetcch Bridge is a stablecoin bridge, as stablecoin are less volatile and every chain has them, we decided to stick to only stablecoins but there's a catch.

We have integrated **DEX aggregators** on every chain that we support, so if you deposit your ETH, MATIC, SOL or any other token, we can successfully convert it to a stablecoin, deposit it in our liquidity pools and you can receive whichever token you want on another chain.

*To better understand the flow*

**We are doing cross chain swaps in less than 30s (tested on all major EVM testnets)**

### FetcchX ID

FetcchX ID Protocol will directly be integrated into various wallets and they can start issuing IDs to their users

So, if Steak Wallet integrates WagPay ID Protocol, they can then issue ids like `name@steak` or `name.steak`, and then this ID can transact with any ID present in FetcchX ID Protocol irrespective of wallet or chain.

This will not just solve P2P payments but **Choice Fatigue in connecting wallets** also.

So right now, there are 100s of options to choose from whenever we are connecting to dApp, but if the dApp has integrated FetcchX ID SDK, then it will just have a single button called Connect Wallet, where the user will enter their ID and a connection request will be sent to their wallet.

dApps can also request a single time transaction using above mechanism, which can be used heavily by payment gateways, it doesn't involve connecting a wallet.
